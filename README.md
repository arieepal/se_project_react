# What to Wear App

## About the project

This app is pretty cool and a great utility to find what to wear and under what weather condition. This is done by making a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. The weather data is then collected and processed, and based on the forecast, the app recommends suitable clothing to the user.
