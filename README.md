# What to Wear App

## About the project

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. After learning about how to be a React Developer, this project was built. This app is pretty cool and a great utility to find what to wear and under what weather condition. This is done by making a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. The weather data is then collected and processed. And based on the forecast, the app recommends suitable clothing to the user. At the top of the page you will see the weather forecast as an image and a temperature. Underneath the temperature will be images of the clothing you should wear for the most comfort to accomidate with the weather conditions.
